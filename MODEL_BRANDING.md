# AI Emergency Kit - Branding Guide

## 🚨 Brand Identity

**AI Emergency Kit** is the official product name and branding for the fine-tuned crisis response model when published.

> **Note:** The pipeline repository (`crisis_agent_finetune`) and dataset repository names remain unchanged for consistency. This branding applies to the **model product itself** when published to Hugging Face.

### Core Concept

**AI Emergency Kit** - Your intelligent crisis response assistant that provides structured, actionable guidance during emergency situations.

### Brand Positioning

- **Reliable**: Trained on comprehensive crisis scenarios
- **Structured**: Provides JSON-formatted, actionable responses

## 📝 Usage Guidelines

### Model Name Format

When naming your model, use variations like:
- `ai-emergency-kit-v1`
- `ai-emergency-kit-mistral-7b`
- `emergency-kit-ai`
- `ai-emergency-assistant`

### Repository Naming

**Note:** The pipeline repository (`crisis_agent_finetune`) and dataset repository names remain unchanged for consistency. The "AI Emergency Kit" branding applies to the **model itself** when published.

For Hugging Face model repositories, you can use:
- ✅ `username/crisis-agent-v1` (maintains consistency with pipeline)
- ✅ `username/crisis-agent-mistral-7b` (descriptive)
- ✅ `username/ai-emergency-kit` (if you prefer the branded name)
- ✅ Any name you choose - the model card will still use "AI Emergency Kit" branding

**Important:** The model card and description will automatically use "AI Emergency Kit" branding regardless of repository name.

### Description Template

When describing the model, use:

> **AI Emergency Kit** - A fine-tuned Mistral-7B model that serves as an intelligent crisis response assistant. Provides structured, actionable guidance during emergency situations with JSON-formatted responses including step-by-step instructions, resource recommendations, and priority actions.
